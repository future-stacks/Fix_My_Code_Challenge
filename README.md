# Fix_My_Code_Challenge
This project is about jumping into an existing code base and fixing it! "Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not."

- Please download the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](./https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.

- You should not recode everything, just fix it!
